Hi, this 'program' is held togeather by nothing more than my own sheer willpower
a few things to note to get this to work
1. the program autohotkey must be installed
2. python must have both pip and sseclient installed

after all that is done, replace the current sibr replay with the sibr replay you want the program to run into the python script file
and change the file location of "windowsvista.txt" in ahk to the path it is on your computer 
(note: "windowsvista.txt" will not appear until after you have run the python file once)

Launch the python script, wait a bit then launch the ahk file
(ahk is needy and sometimes decided it needs a bit of time before its willing to read a file)
after that, you should get a barage of popups that interupt your typing and regular computer needs with blaseball updates, just like you wanted!

Ill be honestly impressed if you can get this to run on your computer as I dont know how to code and essentially brute forced two coding languages to talk
Idealy, however, it will look like this in the end: https://youtu.be/pU22giYbSgU
